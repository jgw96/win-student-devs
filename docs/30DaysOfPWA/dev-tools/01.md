## Introduction

Hello! For todayâ€™s post on the [30 Days of PWA](https://aka.ms/learn-pwa/30Days-blog) series, we will be getting started with some new tooling from the [PWABuilder Project](https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Day-3.1/pwabuilder-link)! The PWABuilder team has been working on new tools for developers at any step of the building process, from starting a brand new PWA to packging your existing PWA for the app stores; PWA Studio and the PWA Starter.

### PWA Studio

PWA Studio is a [VSCode Extension](https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Day-3.1/vscode-link) that makes VSCode the BEST platform for building PWAs. [Install PWA Studio](https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Day-3.1/install-pwa-studio) and you can:
-	Start building a new PWA, with all the best practices, excellent developer experience and exceptional performance    that you expect, in seconds using the PWABuilder pwa-starter.
-	Learn how to publish your app to the Web with Azure Static Web Apps
-	Add a Web Manifest and Service Worker to your existing web app
-	Package your PWA for the Microsoft Store, Google Play, and Apple App Store
-	Generate Icons for your PWA
-	Validate that your PWA is installable in the browser and is ready to publish to the app stores
-	Learn more about the features of the Web Manifest to enable new features in your PWA
-	Use our snippets to quickly and easily implement native features that can improve the User Experience of your PWA.

### PWA Starter

The PWA Starter is a code template (similar to what tools like create-react-app or the Angular CLI can generate) that gives you everything, yes everything, you need to build a high quality PWA. Tired of having to:

- Decide what framework to use?
- Figure out Service Workers?
- Figure out Web Manifests?
- Decided what UI library to use?
- Set up a build system for the billionth time?

The PWA Starter handles all of this for you! Using feedback from the community and our own experiences, we have put together the group of libraries and tools that WE have found work great and are production ready, but also follow our principles of simplicity and using the full power of the web platform.

With the PWA Starter, you get an app that:
- Has no build system to set up and no boilerplate code to add. Everything is included out of the box.
- Has a Service Worker system using [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/)
- Scores close to 100 on Lighthouse out of the box
- Using the [fluent Web Components](insert link), you can build native looking PWAs on Windows
- Has everything needed to be installable in the browser
- Is ready to be package for the app stores using [PWABuilder](https://www.pwabuilder.com)

and all with just a few button clicks ðŸ˜Š.

## Getting Started + Demo

![prefer a video? Click here]()

Let's start building a new Progressive Web App using PWA Studio! PWA Studio's `Start a new App` feature creates your app using the PWA Starter, which means you get everything we just talked about from just a button click! 

1. First, if you have not installed PWA Studio yet, install it from the [VSCode Marketplace](https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Day-3.1/install-pwa-studio).

2. Now that you have PWA Studio installed, tap the PWABuilder Icon on the left side of VSCode

3. You should now see a `Start new PWA` button in the bottom bar of VSCode. Tap this button to start generating a PWA.

4. Enter your respository name when propmted, this is normally the name of your app.

5. Your PWA will be generated using the Starter and all of your dependencies will be installed!

6. At this point, you are now ready to start coding! Tap `f5` or tap `Run` and `Start Debugging` at the top of VSCode. Your new PWA will now open in dev mode, with auto-reload, in its own App window. Enabling you to build your PWA in an app-first manner.


## Under the hood

So, how does all this work? 

PWA Studio uses `Git` (and will warn you if you don't have Git) to fork the latest version of the PWA Starter and then installs the needed dependencies using `npm`. 

PWA Starter uses the following libraries, with a ready-to-go build:

- [**lit**](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/): Our framework of choice. Lit gives us a way to write code that feels remarkably familiar to popular frameworks like React but that compiles down to browser native Web Components with a tiny runtime that provides things such as performant asynchronous rendering. Put plainly, Lit provides that great developer experience that we may be used too but without any sacrifice in either load-time performance or runtime performance.
- [Vaadin Router](https://vaadin.github.io/router/vaadin-router/demo/#vaadin-router-getting-started-demos): For routing, we use the Vaadin router. It is built with web components, has a tiny package size and all the features you expect from modern routers.
- [**Shadow DOM, CSS Variables, Shadow Parts**](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/guide/styles#shadow-dom): Modern CSS is incredibly powerful, especially when combining the Shadow DOM, CSS variables and the Shadow Parts APIs. This provides a lot of the features we normally use a CSS pre-processor for, but without the extra complication that a CSS pre-processor adds to your build steps!
- [**Rollup**](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/): Rollup is a &quot;bundler&quot; or build tool that will make working with NPM modules easy while also helping ensure our code is ready for production. It allows us to do things such as minify our code, run Workbox (another tool I will introduce next) and other build steps.
- [**Workbox**](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/): Workbox is a tool that makes working with [**Service Workers**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) easy!
- [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): TypeScript gives us features such as auto complete in our editors that helps make the development process easier, along with being perfect for working in a team because you can provide types for your APIs, making your code almost self-documenting.
