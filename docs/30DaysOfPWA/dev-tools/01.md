## Introduction

Hello! For todayâ€™s post on the [30 Days of PWA](https://aka.ms/learn-pwa/30Days-blog) series, we will be getting started with some new tooling from the [PWABuilder Project](https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Day-3.1/pwabuilder-link)! The PWABuilder team has been working on new tools for developers at any step of the building process, from starting a brand new PWA to packging your existing PWA for the app stores; PWA Studio and the PWA Starter.

### PWA Studio

PWA Studio is a [VSCode Extension](https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Day-3.1/vscode-link) that makes VSCode the BEST platform for building PWAs. [Install PWA Studio](https://aka.ms/learn-PWA/30Day-3.1/install-pwa-studio) and you can:
-	Start building a new PWA, with all the best practices, excellent developer experience and exceptional performance    that you expect, in seconds using the PWABuilder pwa-starter.
-	Learn how to publish your app to the Web with Azure Static Web Apps
-	Add a Web Manifest and Service Worker to your existing web app
-	Package your PWA for the Microsoft Store, Google Play, and Apple App Store
-	Generate Icons for your PWA
-	Validate that your PWA is installable in the browser and is ready to publish to the app stores
-	Learn more about the features of the Web Manifest to enable new features in your PWA
-	Use our snippets to quickly and easily implement native features that can improve the User Experience of your PWA.

### PWA Starter

The PWA Starter is a code template (similar to what tools like create-react-app or the Angular CLI can generate) that gives you everything, yes everything, you need to build a high quality PWA. Tired of having to:

- Decide what framework to use?
- Figure out Service Workers?
- Figure out Web Manifests?
- Decided what UI library to use?
- Set up a build system for the billionth time?

The PWA Starter handles all of this for you! Using feedback from the community and our own experiences, we have put together the group of libraries and tools that WE have found work great and are production ready, but also follow our principles of simplicity and using the full power of the web platform.

With the PWA Starter, you get an app that:
- Has no build system to set up and no boilerplate code to add. Everything is included out of the box.
- Has a Service Worker system using [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/)
- Scores close to 100 on Lighthouse out of the box
- Using the fluent Web Components, you can build native looking PWAs on Windows
- Has everything needed to be installable in the browser
- Is ready to be package for the app stores using [PWABuilder](https://www.pwabuilder.com)

and all with just a few button clicks ðŸ˜Š.
