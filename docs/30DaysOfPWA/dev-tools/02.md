## What is PWABuilder?
PWABuilder is  a project whose overarching goal is to make building and packaging good quality PWAs a smooth experience for developers. 
[PWABuilder.com](https://www.pwabuilder.com) is a one-stop shop to evaluate and publish your PWA to app stores in a matter of minutes. It strives to achieve the following: 
1.	Create and publish your PWA package to multiple app stores such as the Microsoft store. It eliminates the need to understand the native code or underlying platforms in order to submit to these stores.
2.	Evaluate the quality of your PWA by analyzing the manifest and service worker, and give you recommendations of what can be improved to make your PWA even better.
3.	Allow you to edit your manifest and add more advanced features to your service worker. This means that even if you have a non-PWA website, you can easily convert it into a PWA just by choosing the right “ingredients” from the manifest and service worker options that we provide. 

Fun fact, PWABuilder.com is itself a PWA! It's also completely [open source](https://github.com/pwa-builder/PWABuilder), along with all the other great tools that are part of the PWABuilder suite.

## How it works
Let’s now deep dive into what PWABuilder can do for you. The PWA we are going to use in this walkthrough is Webboard (https://webboard.app), an open source Whiteboarding app.

First, we enter the URL on the homepage of PWABuilder.

<br>
<br>
<div align="center" padding="100px"> 
<img src="_media/02/homepage.png" width="800" padding="100px" alt="Enter a URL on the homepage" title="Enter a URL on the homepage"/>
</div>
<br>
<br>

You will be taken to this report card page that tells you your score for each component of the PWA.

</div>
<br>
<br>

Under the tab “Manifest Options” you can add more details to your manifest. We also help you generate icons of all the sizes needed by the various app stores as well as screenshots that will appear on the PDP pages.

<br>
<br>
<div align="center"> 
<img src="_media/02/Icon_Screenshot_3.png" width="800" alt="Edit your manifest on PWABuider.com" title="Edit your manifest on PWABuider.com"/>
</div>
<br>
<br>

If you don’t have a service worker or would like to improve on your existing one based on your score, go to the “Service Worker Options” Tab. Here we have code for service workers that offer advanced functionality like offline copy, caching media and much more!

<br>
<br>
<div align="center"> 
<img src="_media/02/SWPage_4.png" width="800" alt="Edit your Service worker and add new capabilities" title="Edit your Service worker and add new capabilities"/>
</div>
<br>
<br>

When you’re happy with all the changes you have made, you are now ready to publish! PWABuilder generates packages for your PWA for many app stores such as the Microsoft Store, iOS App store and the Google Play Store.

<br>
<br>
<div align="center"> 
<img src="_media/02/Publish_5.png" width="800" alt="Publish page on PWABuilder" title="Publish page on PWABuilder"/>
</div>
<br>
<br>

There you have it, folks!  That’s how quickly you can go from having a regular web app or a basic PWA, to a polished, high quality PWA that is ready to be published to various app stores!


## Why should you use PWABuilder?
It has to be understood that simply having a web manifest and service worker does not necessarily make a good PWA. With tools like [PWABuilder.com](https://pwabuilder.com), [pwa-starter](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-starter) and [PWA Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PWABuilder.pwa-studio), our vscode extension, we want to help your app reach its potential by harnessing all the powers of PWA technology. Whether you want to start building from scratch, or just need some additional features sprinkled on top to make your PWA shine, PWABuilder's got you covered.
Stay tuned for more!

## Exercise
Try PWABuilder.com today with a website/PWA that you are working on. Run the PWA through PWABuilder, add more capabilities to your service worker and make it publish-ready by filling up all the fields in the manifest. Try generating a test package on the Windows platform in the publish page and sideload it. When you feel your PWA is ready, try publishing it to one of the app stores.
